- Iâ€™m @alfiethology, a PhD researcher at the University of Bristol. I work on space and resource use in laying hens and utilize the latest animal tracking softwares such as YOLOv11 by [ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m also interested in tracking and monitoring wild bird visitation at birdfeeders using Raspberry pi zero with HQ cameras and a PIR motion sensor, see [birdcam](https://github.com/alfiethology/birdcam) for details. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Gaussian mixture models to quantify the space-use of hens on egg farms from the segmented information that comes from the cameras that I have set up on the farms which monitor the birds 12 hours a day.
- I also print my own camera cases with a 3D printer, I have all of my print files available here: [print-parts](https://github.com/alfiethology/print-parts)
